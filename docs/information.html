                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>The Pet system is an innovative and user-friendly platform that aims to connect pet owners with reliable and qualified service providers. The system will be designed as a web and mobile application that allows pet owners to browse, search, and book a variety of pet-related services such as grooming, boarding, and training, among others. The platform will also provide an opportunity for service providers to showcase their skills and services, receive bookings and payments, and manage their schedules and customer interactions.
                        One of the unique features of the Pet system is its rating and review system, which allows pet owners to leave feedback and rate their experience with service providers, thereby creating a trustworthy and transparent community. Moreover, the system will ensure the safety of pets by implementing rigorous vetting and verification processes for service providers, including background checks, references, and certifications.
                        The Pet system will be monetized by charging a commission fee on every booking made through the platform. The revenue model is expected to be scalable, as the system can expand to new cities and countries, providing a one-stop-shop solution for pet owners worldwide.
                        Overall, the Pet system offers a comprehensive and reliable solution for pet owners seeking quality services for their pets, while providing a new and profitable business opportunity for service providers.
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="mb-4">Statement of Need</h2>
                        <p>The increasing trend in the pet industry and the rise in the number of pet owners make it essential to create a comprehensive platform for offering pet services. This platform must provide various services, including nutrition counseling, medical care, hospital services, professional training, breeding and pet care, and many other services to pet owners. Moreover, this platform should address the problems that have led to pet owners' dissatisfaction, such as payment issues, service quality, inappropriate information, and customer dissatisfaction. Due to the growing importance of pets in people's lives, the mentioned platform can be one of the most critical resources in this area and play a fundamental role in improving the quality of life for pets and satisfying their owners.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of medical and health services for pets and the need for efficient and accessible platforms for delivering these services. In addition to COVID-19, the possibility of future pandemics and their potential impact on pets and their owners emphasizes the urgency of creating a comprehensive platform that can provide timely and reliable medical services for pets in any situation. Therefore, creating a comprehensive and efficient platform in the field of pets is necessary not only to improve the quality of life for pets and satisfy their owners but also to address potential public health concerns related to infectious diseases.</p>
                        <p>As pets are considered family members in many societies and have a strong emotional connection with their owners, it is essential to provide comprehensive and professional services to these animals. Due to the dynamic pet market and the increase in the number of pet owners worldwide, many owners are seeking various services that include care, breeding, hygiene, and treatment of their pets. With the expansion of social networks and technology, most pet owners use online services for their pets. However, some of these services are unprofessional, and pet owners cannot trust them. Therefore, the existence of a comprehensive platform that provides various professional pet services can meet the needs of pet owners and improve the quality of life for their pets, not only in the current situation but also in the face of potential future challenges.</p>

The system will be accessible from any device with an internet connection and will be secure and reliable. The microservices architecture will allow for flexibility and scalability, ensuring that the system can be easily expanded in the future. The project will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of web-based systems development, including microservices architecture and Agile methodology. The project team will gain valuable experience in software development, project management, and Agile methodology, which will benefit future projects. Overall, the PET project will provide a valuable solution for pet owners and contribute to the development of innovative web-based systems.</p>

We will also collect feedback from the system developers and administrators to identify areas for improvement.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb-4">Quantitative measures:</h5>
                            <p>- We will use several metrics to assess the system's performance, including:</p>
                            <p>- Number of registered pets and their owners</p>
                            <p>- Number of appointments scheduled and completed through the system</p>
                            <p>- Time and cost savings achieved by using the system compared to traditional appointment booking methods</p>
                            <p>- Customer satisfaction scores and feedback collected through surveys and online reviews</p>
                            <p>- Reduction in errors or missed appointments compared to traditional methods</p>
                            <p>- Cost-benefit analysis of implementing and maintaining the system compared to the potential revenue generated from increased appointment bookings and customer retention.</p>
                            <p>Overall, the evaluation will provide valuable insights into the system's effectiveness and inform future improvements and enhancements to ensure the PET system remains a valuable resource for pet owners and veterinary clinics.</p>
